####Functions

A <i><b>function</b></i> is a way of maching up one set of numbers with another. The first set of numbers is called the <b><i>domain</i></b>. For each of the numbers in the domain, the function assigns exactly one number from the other set, the range.

For example, the domain of the function could be the set of numbers {1, 4, 9, 25, 100}, and the range could be {1, 2, 3, 5, 10}. Suppose the function takes 1 to 1, 4 to 4,2, 9 to 3, 25 to 5, and 100 to 10. This could be illustrated by the following:
```
    1  ->  1
    4  ->  4
    9  ->  3
    25 -> 25
   100 -> 10
```
   
Because we sometimes use several fuctions in the same discussion, it makes sense to give them names. Let us call the function we just mentioned by the name <i>Eugene</i>. Thus, we can ask, "Hey, what does Eugene do with the number 4?" The answer is "Eugene takes 4 to the number 2."

Mathematicians like to write as little as possible. Thus, instead of writing "Eugene takes 4 to the number 2," we often write "Eugene(4) = 2" to mean the same thing. Similarly, we like to use names that are as short as possible, such as f(for function), g(for function when f is already being used), h, and so on.
